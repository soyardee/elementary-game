#Falling Stars (Elementary Game)

This is a simple game programmed in Java, with no external dependencies!
I would not suggest doing this ever if the requirements weren't so stringent on using java.
Please take note that the target audience of this game is a small 2nd grade class for a freshman CS project. This game has less than stellar optimizations, but is far above the minimum requirements.


The game is simple:
Your objective is to manuevuer through an asteriod field, shooting as many as possible within the time limit.
You can only fire 5 rounds per reload.
To gain more ammunition, press the down arrow to pull up a simple question. If it is answered correctly, your ammo will recharge.


High scores are recorded in an xml file in the runtime directory. It will be created upon first run.
